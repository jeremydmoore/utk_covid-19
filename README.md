# UTK COVID-19 data

This repository currently contains my collected data from [UTK's](https://utk.edu) public [COVID-19 dashboard](https://veoci.com/veoci/p/form/4jmds5x4jj4j#tab=entryForm) and the Jupyter notebook I am using to collect it.

The [screenshot-and-ocr](https://github.com/jeremydmoore/utk_covid-19/blob/master/notebooks/screenshot-and-ocr.ipynb) notebook contains steps to screenshot and OCR the dashboard. Currently I am only collecting data in the form of PNG screenshots in the [data directory](https://github.com/jeremydmoore/utk_covid-19/tree/master/data). These screenshots are named "screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM" with the HHMM in a 24-hr clock. Once I have collected more datapoints, I will begin parsing the COVID-19 text data.
